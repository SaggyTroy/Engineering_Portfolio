# About
Heyo! I'm Joseph and I'm a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

I hail from Brooklyn, New York City, and I've had a love for design and tinkering for as long as I can remember. My engineering experience actually started in the band, where I grew fascinated with the complex design of the clarinet and became obsessed with repairing my instrument every time it broke (I bought it for very cheap off eBay). I then did tons of robotics in high school, working on both the software and hardware side, as well as volunteering at the local hospital, leading to my interest in the cross-sections between medicine and engineering.

Currently, I am harnessing my love for engineering by designing and building all sorts of systems for a Formula race car in MIT Motorsports. I also do research at a translational engineering lab, applying my passion for innovation in medicine to develop microneedle medical devices that advance contraceptive medicine.

All my experiences allow me to learn and apply skills in all sorts of interdisciplinary fields, from structures and electronics to biology and material science, which I can share to others here!

Thanks for checking out my portfolio and I hope you enjoy the ride!
