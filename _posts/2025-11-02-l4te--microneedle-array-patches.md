Since December 2024, I have been conducting part-time research at the [Laboratory of Translational Engineering](https://www.l4te.org/), contributing to the design, fabrication, and testing efforts of the Microneedle Array Patches (MAPs) team. My work primarily focuses on streamlining the manufacturing processes for microneedle devices to accelerate testing and iteration. Our team embraces an iterative engineering design approach—designing, prototyping, testing, and refining until reaching a minimum viable product—making rapid experimentation central to our progress.

My contributions include evaluating new polymer materials for integration into fabrication workflows, developing and documenting standardized manufacturing procedures in our traveler guide, and designing and fabricating tooling for rimless device variants. Through this work, I’ve developed a broad range of technical skills, including resin print post-processing, silicone mold casting, vacuum compression molding, and bioanalytics data analysis.

Equally valuable, however, are the soft skills this experience has fostered. With biweekly in vivo studies on minipigs at our animal facility, design requirements evolve constantly, demanding adaptability, precision, and perseverance—especially when repeated failures are part of the learning process. Working with microneedles at the micron scale has strengthened my attention to detail and appreciation for quality control. Moreover, learning to navigate the lab’s workflow—from maintaining traveler documents and inventory spreadsheets to coordinating through daily morning meetings—has deepened my understanding of how structured communication and collaboration drive successful research.

All in all, I am eternally grateful for the wonderful MAPs family I have found, supporting me as mentors, co-workers, and friends, and pushing me to be the person I am today.
